This repository contains my ESP8266 based projects. All these are somehow related to my home automation system. Devices and sensors that are conrolled by ESP8266 are:
- SDS11 air quality sensor
- Awning open/close control
- Current Cost electric power (kWh) meter
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor (not actively used anymore, switched on using Ruuvi -tags)
- DS18B20 (not much used, Ruuvi rocks better)
- FD35 Mitsubishi air-source heat pump
- IHC (Intelligent Home Control) Danish system to control lighting and power sockets
- MP3 speaking home assistant (a bit like Amazon Alexa, but speaks only, not listening)
- GWM95R Vaisala wall transmitter (temperature, humidity and CO2)
- Relay control of couple of devices
- SIM808 (2G modem module control via AT commands)
- TX23 wind direction and speed sensor
- Vallox library and ValloxDSE application to control Vallox Digit SE ventillation machine
- Ventillator to control a simple fan (kanavapuhallin) connected to a cheapo remotely (433MHz) controlled power socket
- Water meter to count pulses from a watermeter
